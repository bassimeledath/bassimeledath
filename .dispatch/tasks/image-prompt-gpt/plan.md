# Image Prompt Ideas (GPT 5.3)

- [x] Read the blog post at content/blog/dispatch.mdx to understand what Dispatch does
- [x] Read the site's design system: app/globals.css, tailwind.config.ts, app/layout.tsx to understand the visual aesthetic
- [x] Read the existing project image at data/projects.ts to understand what's already used
- [x] Think through 3 distinct image prompt directions for a blog hero/thumbnail that captures the before/after of Dispatch — left half shows the chaos of juggling multiple Claude Code terminal sessions, right half shows the calm of dispatching from one session. The image should feel like it belongs in the Claude Code ecosystem (terminal aesthetic, dark mode). Each prompt should be fully fleshed out and ready to paste into an image generator. (Defined directions: cinematic UI scene, retro-futurist terminal blueprint, and editorial 3D workstation.)
- [x] Write the 3 prompts with rationale for each to .dispatch/tasks/image-prompt-gpt/output.md

# Dispatch Blog Hero / Thumbnail Image Prompts

## 1) Cinematic "Terminal Storm -> Command Seat"

**Prompt**

Create a cinematic split-screen hero image (16:9) for a developer blog post about "Dispatch" in the Claude Code ecosystem.

Left half (BEFORE): pure terminal chaos. Show 7-10 overlapping dark terminal windows, each with monospace text, different task threads, scrolling logs, repeated context pasted over and over, and visual overload from context switching. Use subtle red/orange warning hints and tangled window layering to communicate cognitive load. Make it feel like one engineer is juggling too many Claude Code sessions at once.

Right half (AFTER): one clean, centered terminal session with a calm, confident layout. Show a single command being run: `/dispatch "review auth edge cases"`. From this one terminal, depict multiple background worker lanes/cards branching out neatly and reporting back status/checklist progress. The main session remains uncluttered and readable.

Style and mood: premium terminal aesthetic, dark mode, modern developer tooling vibe, high contrast, crisp UI details, shallow depth of field, subtle glow.

Color direction: dark brown-charcoal base (`#1C1A17`), cream highlights (`#FAFAF8`), amber accent (`#B4530A`) for key flows and emphasis, muted warm grays for secondary UI.

Composition rules: exact 50/50 split, obvious before/after contrast, eye should travel from left mess to right clarity in one glance. No logos, no watermarks, no human faces, no random gibberish typography blocks.

**Rationale**

This is the most emotionally direct option: instant "pain vs relief" storytelling, with clear terminal-native visuals that align tightly with Claude Code users.

## 2) Retro-Futurist "Ops Blueprint" Poster

**Prompt**

Generate a bold split-screen technical-art poster (16:9) that looks like a retro-futurist operations blueprint for AI coding workflows.

Left half (BEFORE): chaotic network map made of terminal windows and command nodes, connected by noisy spaghetti lines, loopbacks, and crossed arrows. Add subtle glitch artifacts and jittered outlines to imply constant context switching between many Claude Code sessions.

Right half (AFTER): elegant orchestration diagram anchored by one primary terminal node labeled via command text: `/dispatch "..."`. From that node, clean geometric routes fan out to worker nodes (research, review, refactor), then converge back as tidy status/checklist returns. The right side should feel mathematically organized, almost zen.

Visual language: terminal UI glyphs, monospace micro-labels, diagrammatic arrows, grid system, minimal but striking.

Color direction: warm dark background with copper/amber routing lines (`#B4530A`), cream annotation strokes, low-saturation blue/green only as small secondary node colors. Keep it mostly warm and cohesive.

Stylistic constraints: sharp linework, editorial poster quality, high legibility at thumbnail size, no photo realism, no mascots, no brand logos.

**Rationale**

This direction is distinct from standard UI mockups and reads as a memorable concept image. It communicates orchestration architecture in a way that stands out while still feeling developer-native.

## 3) Editorial 3D "Dual Workstation" Scene

**Prompt**

Create a high-end editorial 3D illustration (16:9), split-screen, set in a dark developer workspace with terminal-heavy interfaces.

Left half (BEFORE): a cluttered workstation with multiple monitors/layers of terminal panes, stacked tabs, floating notifications, and conflicting task queues. Show visual motion trails between windows to imply frantic switching between many Claude Code sessions. Keep everything terminal-centric and text-grid based.

Right half (AFTER): a minimalist workstation view with one primary terminal window in focus. It dispatches background workers from a single session (show command entry `/dispatch "refactor parser + run review"`), while small organized worker panels run in parallel and return concise progress updates. Spacious composition, fewer elements, controlled lighting, clear hierarchy.

Material and lighting: matte dark surfaces, soft warm key light, subtle amber reflections, cinematic shadows. UI elements should glow gently, not neon overload.

Color direction: dark espresso and warm charcoal foundation, amber accents for action/progress (`#B4530A`), cream text highlights to match the site tone, restrained saturation.

Output goals: polished, scroll-stopping hero art suitable for a modern engineering blog. No characters, no logos, no watermark, avoid unreadable nonsense text blocks.

**Rationale**

This gives a tactile, premium look that feels less like a diagram and more like branded editorial art, useful if you want the blog hero to feel product-grade and visually differentiated.
